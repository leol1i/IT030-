             that might compete with your inline or internal CSS. */

  /*
    Add more rules if desired:
    - Paragraphs (p)
    - Footer
    - etc.
  */
  footer {
    color: blue !important;
    background-color: antiquewhite;
    padding: 1px;
    }
  /*
    For demonstration:
    - Show which rules get overridden by your internal <style> block
    - Which might get overridden by inline styles
    - Comment your observations about the cascade and inheritance
    In cascade, the order of priority from low to high is:
    Inline, Internal, and External.
    Inheritance is when you specify the font-family or color properties on the <body> element and is inherited by the child element.
    So the value would apply to all the elements unless overridden by an internal or inline CSS. 
    This inheritance section was found in chapter 10, page 240. My PDF version of the textbook is on chpt 10 and not 12 like the instruction says.
