  <!--
     TODO #1 (External CSS):
      Link to your external 'style.css' file here.
      For reference, see Chapter 5 about including CSS files.
      I found this in Chapter 10 page 235. My PDF version of the textbook is different from the instructions.
  -->
    <link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
    <!-- removed "/" at the end because it's not needed in HTML5 according to validator -->
  <!--
     TODO #2 (Internal CSS):
      Add an internal <style> block here with at least one rule.
      For example, you might style the <body> or <footer>.
      Refer to Chapter 5's section on using the <style> element.
  -->
    <!-- removed "type="text/css" from end of <style> because it's not needed according to validator
        Found this part from chapter 10 page 236 -->
    <style> 
     body {
        font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
        background-color: rgb(250,250,250);}
     footer{
        color:orange;}
     h1 {
        color: blue;}
    </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!--
    TODO #3 (Inline CSS):
      Add a style attribute to at least one element, e.g. this <h1>.
      Example:
        <h1 style="color: blue; font-family: serif;">My Demo</h1>
      Then explain in a comment which Chapter 5 property/properties are used
      and how they might override the external or internal CSS if conflicts arise.
      This is demonstrated in chapter 10 with the cascade order. 
      If the style.css has a rule for h1, it would be overidden by an internal css. 
      The internal css would also be overriden by an inline css, which has the highest specificity.
      Found this on chapter 10, "How CSS rules cascade" page 239.
  -->
      
    <h1 style= "font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;
            color: green;">Welcome to My Chapter 5 Demo
    </h1>
    <p>
        This paragraph should demonstrate <strong>inheritance</strong>.
        If you set a 'color' or 'font-family' on the body or a parent element,
        it should automatically apply here, unless it's overridden.
        <!-- fixed the <body> to "body" because it was being used an element with no close -->
    </p>
    <p>
        Modify colors, fonts, text size, etc. in your external or internal CSS.
        Observe how the CSS cascade and inheritance affect these paragraphs
        vs. any inline-styled elements.
    </p>

  <!--
      TODO #4 (Demonstrate Cascade):
      For example, if your external CSS sets a color on <h1>,
      and your internal CSS sets a different color, see which one wins.
      Add a short comment explaining the result according to Chapter 5
      on the CSS cascade.
      My <h1> has an external color of "coral", 
      internal of "blue", and an inline of "green" styles. As a result, 
      the inline CSS takes priority due to higher specificity in the cascade.
